## Tasks

**0. Markov Chain**
---
Write the function def markov_chain(P, s, t=1):
that determines the probability of a markov chain
being in a particular state after a specified
number of iterations.

**1. Regular Chains**
---
Write the function def regular(P): that determines 
the steady state probabilities of a regular markov chain.

**2. Absorbing Chains**
---
Write the function def absorbing(P): that determines if 
a markov chain is absorbing.

---
Write the function def forward(Observation, Emission,
Transition, Initial): that performs the forward algorithm
for a hidden markov model.

**4. The Viretbi Algorithm**
---
Write the function def viterbi(Observation, Emission,

Transition=None, Emission=None, Initial=None): that performs
the Baum-Welch algorithm for a hidden markov model.
