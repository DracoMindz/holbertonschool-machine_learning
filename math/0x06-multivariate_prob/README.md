## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### ***General***
```
Who is Carl Friedrich Gauss?
What is a joint/multivariate distribution?
What is a covariance?
What is a correlation coefficient?
What is a covariance matrix?
What is a multivariate gaussian distribution?
```

***0. Mean and Covariance***

Write a function that calculates the mean and covariance of a data set.

***1. Correlation***

Write a function that calculates a correlation matrix.

***2. Initialize***

Create the class MultiNormal that represents a Multivariate Normal distribution.

***3. PDF***

Update the class MultiNormal with  public instance method that calculates the PDF at a data point.
