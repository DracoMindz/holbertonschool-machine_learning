### Tasks

***0. Likelihood***
Write a function def likelihood(x, n, P): that calculates the likelihood 
of obtaining this data given various hypothetical probabilities of 
developing severe side effects.

***1. Intersection***
Based on 0-likelihood.py, write a function def intersection(x, n, P, Pr):
that calculates the intersection of obtaining this data with the various 
hypothetical probabilities.

***2. Marginal Probability***
Based on 1-intersection.py, write a function def marginal(x, n, P, Pr):
that calculates the marginal probability of obtaining the data.

***3. Posterior***
Based on 2-marginal.py, write a function def posterior(x, n, P, Pr):
that calculates the posterior probability for the various hypothetical 
probabilities of developing severe side effects given the data.
