# 0x07. Convolutional Neural Networks
Specializations - Machine Learning â€• Supervised Learning

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### ***General***
```
What is a convolutional layer?

What is a pooling layer?

Forward propagation over convolutional and pooling layers

Back propagation over convolutional and pooling layers

How to build a CNN using Tensorflow and Keras
```

## Tasks

***0. Convolutional Forward Prop***

Write a function def conv_forward(A_prev, W, b, activation, padding="same", stride=(1, 1)): that performs forward propagation over a convolutional layer of a neural network

***1. Pooling Forward Prop***

Write a function def pool_forward(A_prev, kernel_shape, stride=(1, 1), mode='max'): that performs forward propagation over a pooling layer of a neural network

***2. Convolutional Back Prop***

Write a function def conv_backward(dZ, A_prev, W, b, padding="same", stride=(1, 1)): that performs back propagation over a convolutional layer of a neural network

***3. Pooling Back Prop***

Write a function def pool_backward(dA, A_prev, kernel_shape, stride=(1, 1), mode='max'): that performs back propagation over a pooling layer of a neural network

***4. LeNet-5 (Tensorflow)***

Write a function def lenet5(x, y): that builds a modified version of the LeNet-5 architecture using tensorflow

***5. LeNet-5 (Keras)***
Write a function def lenet5(X): that builds a modified version of the LeNet-5 architecture using keras
