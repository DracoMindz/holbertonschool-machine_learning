#0x0B Face Verification
Specializations - Machine Learning â€• Supervised Learning

##Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
```
General
What is face recognition?
What is face verification?
What is dlib?
How to use dlib for detecting facial landmarks
What is an affine transformation?
What is face alignment?
Why would you use facial alignment?
How to use opencv-python for face alignment
What is one-shot learning?
What is triplet loss?
How to create custom Keras layers
How to add losses to a custom Keras layer
How to create a Face Verification system
What are the ethical quandaries regarding facial recognition/verification?
```


For this project dlib 19.17.0 was a required install.
