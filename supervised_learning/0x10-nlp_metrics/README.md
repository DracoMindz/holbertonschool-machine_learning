# Natural Language Processing - Evaluation Metrics
Specializations - Machine Learning - Supervised Learning

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google.


**General**
```
    What are the applications of natural language processing?
    What is a BLEU score?
    What is a ROUGE score?
    What is perplexity?
    When should you use one evaluation metric over another?
```
0. Unigram BLEU score
 
Write the function def uni_bleu(references, sentence):
that calculates the unigram BLEU score for a sentence.
---

1. N-gram BLEU score

Write the function def ngram_bleu(references, sentence, n):
that calculates the n-gram BLEU score for a sentence.
---

2. Cumulative N-gram BLEU score

Write the function def cumulative_bleu(references, sentence, n):
that calculates the cumulative n-gram BLEU score for a sentence.
