# 0x08. Deep Convolutional Architectures
Specializations - Machine Learning ― Supervised Learning


## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google.

### General
```
What is a skip connection?
What is a bottleneck layer?
What is the Inception Network?
What is ResNet? ResNeXt? DenseNet?
How to replicate a network architecture by reading a journal article?
```
