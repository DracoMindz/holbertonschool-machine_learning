What is the softmax function and when do you use it?
What is cross-entropy loss?
What is pickling in Python?
```

0. One-Hot Encode mandatory
Write a function def one_hot_encode(Y, classes): that converts a numeric label vector into a one-hot matrix:

1. One-Hot Decode mandatory
Write a function def one_hot_decode(one_hot): that converts a one-hot matrix into a vector of labels:

2. Persistence is Key mandatory
Update the class DeepNeuralNetwork

3. Update DeepNeuralNetwork mandatory
Update the class DeepNeuralNetwork to perform multiclass classification

4. All the Activations mandatory
Update the class DeepNeuralNetwork to allow different activation functions
